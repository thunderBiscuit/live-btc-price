# Readme

The simplest bitcoin price ticker on the internets!

See the [live website here](https://thunderbiscuit.github.io/live-btc-price/).

Perfect for customization. Feel free to fork and adapt to your specific needs, or open an issue and let me know what you'd like to see added!

## Download different versions locally

There are currenlty three versions of the project:

### Basic version

The full website with a static directory containing stylesheets, JS, and images. Easier to build upon if you need to adjust some things or plan to build on it more seriously. You can download the specific tag using:

```shell
git clone --branch basic https://github.com/thunderBiscuit/live-btc-price.git
```

### Single page

The "one page" version (onefile branch) which is as simple as it gets. You can download that file, double-click on it, and it will run locally. No need to use my website at all. Download the specific tag using:

```shell
git clone --branch basic https://github.com/thunderBiscuit/live-btc-price.git
```

### My own latest version (hosted on github pages)

This is just the master branch. It contains twitter card metadata for sharing, etc. But the metadata is written for this particular version I run on gitpages, so be aware that if you download that you'll need to make some changes.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thunderBiscuit/live-btc-price.git
```
